# Silver-tutorial

The Google Silver tutorial should cover

- our motivation for using attribute grammars, specifically our
  interest in composable and "analyzable" specifications
  - say something about Knuth in 1968 and that these things continue
    to get a steady, if low-level, amount of interest
  - the ableC slide about composition maybe
  
- Program syntax - concrete to abstract
  - AST - defined by a grammar
  
- semantic information on those tree nodes
  - attributes
  
- equations to determine their value 
- Grammars, attributes, equations - the basics
  - AG evaluation - using the animation slides
